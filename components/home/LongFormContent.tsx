          Why Discoverability Matters in ChatGPT

            When Apple launched the App Store in 2009, there were 6 million iPhones in distribution. Today, ChatGPT has 850 million weekly users. That's over 10% of the global population - and OpenAI just released the Apps SDK. The opportunity to build inside ChatGPT is enormous, and companies are already rushing to do it.

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            And this is only the beginning. More of our digital activity is moving inside LLMs - searching, creating, planning, working. Building apps inside ChatGPT, or having your brand present there, isn't a nice-to-have anymore. It's where your users are heading - and it's quickly becoming a customer expectation. The apps that are present will be the ones that get used, capturing an increasing share of attention over time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Just like the mobile App Store, building great applications will be critical. But a great app is nothing without discoverability. As the ecosystem fills with apps, it will become your single biggest bottleneck to growth. The teams that crack it will be the ones that succeed.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In ChatGPT, discoverability starts with the App Store - and it's already live. Just like the Apple App Store, the apps that rank for high-volume keywords get the traffic. You need to make sure you're found there. Optimizing your metadata, descriptions, and positioning will matter.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            But on top of that, there's a whole new paradigm: organic recommendations. When someone is planning a trip and asks ChatGPT to help organize their itinerary, an app can appear right below the response - at the moment of highest intent. No search. No browsing. Users simply continue their journey with that app. This is distribution that's never existed before.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            As more apps flood in, the question becomes urgent: when a user asks for help, which app appears below the response? Which one ranks first in the store for the keywords that matter? The teams that understand discoverability - and own the high-volume keywords and prompts in their category - will win. The rest will be invisible.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            That's why we're building Appsdiscoverability.com. We track where your app ranks across both the store and organic recommendations. We show you which keywords and prompts your competitors are winning. And we give you specific actions to climb - so you're not just building a great app, but making sure it gets found.
